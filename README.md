# ocad-dreamspace
Website created during Interactive Web Design course at OCAD University.

For some reason, I'm not able to launch it through GitHub. Oh well, I'll figure it out someday.

EDIT: Got it (https://open-meadow.github.io/ocad-dreamspace/)

We were asked to create a website that simulates a dream-like environment. I decided to take nightmare-like scenarios (such as parents shouting at me, or getting very poor grades) and depict it in a web environment.
